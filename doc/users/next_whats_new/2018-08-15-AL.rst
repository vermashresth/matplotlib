The MATPLOTLIBRC environment variable can now point to any "file" path
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

This includes device files; in particular, on Unix systems, one can set
``MATPLOTLIBRC`` to ``/dev/null`` to ignore the user's matplotlibrc file and
fall back to Matplotlib's defaults.

As a reminder, if ``MATPLOTLIBRC`` points to a directory, Matplotlib will try
to load the matplotlibrc file from ``$MATPLOTLIBRC/matplotlibrc``.
