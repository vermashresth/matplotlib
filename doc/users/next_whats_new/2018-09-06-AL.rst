Return type of ArtistInspector.get_aliases changed
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

`ArtistInspector.get_aliases` previously returned the set of aliases as
``{fullname: {alias1: None, alias2: None, ...}}``.  The dict-to-None mapping
was used to simulate a set in earlier versions of Python.  It has now been
replaced by a set, i.e. ``{fullname: {alias1, alias2, ...}}``.

This value is also stored in `ArtistInspector.aliasd`, which has likewise
changed.
