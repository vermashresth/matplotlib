``:math:`` directive renamed to ``:mathmpl:``
`````````````````````````````````````````````

The ``:math:`` rst role provided by `matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl` has been
renamed to ``:mathmpl:`` to avoid conflicting with the ``:math:`` role that
Sphinx 1.8 provides by default.  (``:mathmpl:`` uses Matplotlib to render math
expressions to images embedded in html, whereas Sphinx uses MathJax.)

When using Sphinx<1.8, both names (``:math:`` and ``:mathmpl:``) remain
available for backcompatibility.
