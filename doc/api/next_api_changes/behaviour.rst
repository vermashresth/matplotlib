Behaviour changes
-----------------

``Formatter.fix_minus``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
`.Formatter.fix_minus` now performs hyphen-to-unicode-minus replacement
whenever :rc:`axes.unicode_minus` is True; i.e. its behavior matches the one
of ``.ScalarFormatter.fix_minus`` (`.ScalarFormatter` now just inherits that
implementation).

This replacement is now used by the ``format_data_short`` method of the various
builtin formatter classes, which affects the cursor value in the GUI toolbars.

``FigureCanvasBase`` now always has a ``manager`` attribute, which may be None
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Previously, it did not necessarily have such an attribute.  A check for
``hasattr(figure.canvas, "manager")`` should now be replaced by
``figure.canvas.manager is not None`` (or ``getattr(figure.canvas, "manager", None) is not None``
for back-compatibility).
