`.matplotlib.Axes.get_tightbbox` now includes all artists
---------------------------------------------------------

Layout tools like `.Figure.tight_layout`, ``constrained_layout``,
and ``fig.savefig('fname.png', bbox_inches="tight")`` use
`.matplotlib.Axes.get_tightbbox` to determine the bounds of each axes on
a figure and adjust spacing between axes.

In Matplotlib 2.2 ``get_tightbbox`` started to include legends made on the
axes, but still excluded some other artists, like text that may overspill an
axes.  For Matplotlib 3.0, *all* artists are now included in the bounding box.

This new default may be overridden in either of two ways:

1. Make the artist to be excluded a child of the figure, not the axes. E.g., 
   call ``fig.legend()`` instead of ``ax.legend()`` (perhaps using
   `~.matplotlib.Axes.get_legend_handles_labels` to gather handles and labels
   from the parent axes).
2. If the artist is a child of the axes, set the artist property
   ``artist.set_in_layout(False)``.
